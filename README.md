# File IO Lab

## Learning Goals

- Practice using file IO.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Module**: a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module's
functions, classes, and global variables can be accessed by other modules.
- **Package**: a collection of modules that can be accessed as a group using
the package name.
- **`import`**: the Python keyword used to access data from other packages and
modules inside of the current module.
- **PyPI**: the **Py**thon **P**ackage **I**ndex. A repository of Python
packages that can be downloaded and made available to your application.
- **`pip`**: the command line tool used to download packages from PyPI. `pip`
is installed on your computer automatically when you download Python.
- **Virtual Environment**: a collection of modules, packages, and scripts that
can be activated or deactivated at any time.
- **Pipenv**: a virtual environment tool that uses `pip` to manage the modules,
packages, and scripts that you intend to use in your application.

## Introduction

In the last lesson we learned about the tools that can help us work
with files. Creating and manipulating files is a crucial skill that can
help you create useful and complex programs. In this lab we will explore
file IO.

***

## Instructions

Lets practice! In the file `lib/file_io.py` write a function called `write_file` that takes in the arguments `file_name` and `file_content`.

The `file_name` can be a combined file path/name, you will need to add the `.txt` file extension
to the `file_name` when opening a file for all three of the methods.

This function should use `file_name` and `file_content` to write a `.txt`
file.

Write a `append_file` function that takes in the same parameters and
appends to the `.txt` file.

Write a `read_file` function that takes in a file name and returns the
 content of the `.txt` file.

Example usage:

```py
# use write_file function. 
write_file(file_name="logfile", file_content="Log 1: 5 bananas added" )
append_file(file_name="logfile", append_content="Log 2: 3 bananas subtracted")

read_file(file_name="logfile")
# Log 1: 5 bananas added
# Log 2: 3 bananas subtracted
```

Time to get some practice! Write your code in the `file_io.py` file in the
`lib/` folder. Run `pytest -x` to check your work.

When all of your tests are passing, submit your work using `git`.
